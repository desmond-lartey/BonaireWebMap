# Enhancing Active Mobility in Bonaire

## Overview
In recent years, there has been a global call to increase physical activity levels, especially among vulnerable population groups. Incorporating physical activities such as walking and cycling into daily routines can significantly benefit public and planetary health. This need is particularly pressing in the Caribbean, where physical activity levels are low, and obesity, mortality, and morbidity rates are high. The Caribbean Dutch municipality of Bonaire is no exception, with data indicating that 60% of its residents suffer from overweight, obesity, and other preventable health conditions.

Bonaire is a small island with a population of approximately 25,000, located 80km from the coast of Venezuela. In 2024, the Urban Cycling Institute initiated a project, supported by the Netherlands' Ministry of Public Health, aimed at increasing physical activity levels on Bonaire through active mobility. This four-year project involves a multidisciplinary team of researchers from the Urban Cycling Institute, staff from the Ministry of Health, Welfare, and Sports, and local stakeholders from various sectors on the island. A key player in this project is Rita Gemerts of Ray-Action, who acts as an embedded citizen scientist providing context-specific knowledge, stakeholder networks, and local programs and interventions.

## Project Goals
The project will culminate in the development of a suite of evidence-based policy recommendations designed to increase physical activity among the population of Bonaire. Central to the project is community-based participatory research, which involves local stakeholders and citizens throughout the entire process. This approach ensures that the policy actions developed are tailored specifically for Bonaire by Bonaireans.
